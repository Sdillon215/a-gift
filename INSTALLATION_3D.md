# 3D Starfield Installation Guide

To enable the 3D starfield background with scroll-based parallax effects, you need to install the following dependencies:

## Required Packages

```bash
npm install @react-three/fiber @react-three/drei framer-motion three
```

## What Each Package Does

- **@react-three/fiber**: React renderer for Three.js, allows you to use Three.js in React components
- **@react-three/drei**: Collection of useful helpers and abstractions for React Three Fiber
- **framer-motion**: Animation library for React, used for scroll-based parallax effects
- **three**: 3D graphics library for JavaScript

## Files Created

1. **src/components/Starfield.tsx** - 3D starfield component with React Three Fiber
2. **src/hooks/useScrollProgress.ts** - Custom hook to track scroll progress
3. **src/app/home/page.tsx** - Updated home page with 3D background and parallax effects

## Features

- **3D Starfield**: Procedurally generated stars with different colors (white, blue, purple)
- **Scroll Parallax**: Stars move based on scroll position, creating depth illusion
- **Nebula Effects**: Subtle nebula-like spheres for atmospheric depth
- **Framer Motion**: Smooth animations and scroll-based transforms
- **Responsive**: Works on all screen sizes
- **Performance Optimized**: Uses efficient rendering techniques

## How It Works

1. The `Starfield` component creates a 3D scene with 10,000+ stars
2. The `useScrollProgress` hook tracks scroll position (0 to 1)
3. As you scroll, the stars move in 3D space, creating a "flying through space" effect
4. The navbar and content have different parallax speeds for layered depth
5. Additional content sections encourage scrolling to experience the full effect

## Fallback

If the packages aren't installed yet, the page will show TypeScript errors but won't break. Install the packages to see the full 3D effect.
